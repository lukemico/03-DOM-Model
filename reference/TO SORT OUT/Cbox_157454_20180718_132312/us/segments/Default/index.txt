Enjoy all your entertainment in one place.

The Apple TV app lets you browse movies, shows, handpicked recommendations, and more from over 60 video services. All without switching from one app to the next. And it’s already on your new Apple TV, so all you need to do is get watching.

The Watch Now tab serves up your favorite movies, shows, and handpicked recommendations. The Library tab is home to all of your previous purchases and current rentals. And the Store tab is where you’ll find supported apps and discover the latest movies and TV shows.

The Apple TV app is on iPhone and iPad, too. So if you don’t have time to finish a movie or show at home, you can pick up where you left off — wherever you go.
