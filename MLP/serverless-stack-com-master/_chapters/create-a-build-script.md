description: To configure our Create React App with Netlify, we need to add a build script to our project root. To make sure that we return a HTTP status code of 200 for our React Router routes we will be adding a redirects rule.

Before we can add our project to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) we just need to set up a build script. If you recall, we had configured our app to use the `REACT_APP_STAGE` build environment variable. We are going to create a build script to tell Netlify to set this variable up for the different deployment cases.

### Add the Netlify Build Script

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Start by adding the following to a file called `netlify.toml` to your project root.

``` toml
# Global settings applied to the whole site.
# “base” is directory to change to before starting build, and
# “publish” is the directory to publish (relative to root of your repo).
# “command” is your build command.

[build]
  base    = ""
  publish = "build"
  command = "REACT_APP_STAGE=dev npm run build"

# Production context: All deploys to the main
# repository branch will inherit these settings.
[context.production]
  command = "REACT_APP_STAGE=prod npm run build"

# Deploy Preview context: All Deploy Previews
# will inherit these settings.
[context.deploy-preview]
  command = "REACT_APP_STAGE=dev npm run build"

# Branch Deploy context: All deploys that are not in
# an active Deploy Preview will inherit these settings.
[context.branch-deploy]
  command = "REACT_APP_STAGE=dev npm run build"
```

The build script is configured based on contexts. There is a default one right up top. There are three parts to this:

1. The `base` is the directory where Netlify will run our build commands. In our case it is in the project root. So this is left empty.

2. The `publish` option points to where our build is generated. In the case of Create React App it is the `build` directory in our project root.

3. The `command` option is the build command that Netlify will use. If you recall the [Manage environments in Create React App]({% link _chapters/manage-environments-in-create-react-app.md %}) chapter, this will seem familiar. In the default context the command is `REACT_APP_STAGE=dev npm run build`.

The production context labelled, `context.production` is the only one where we set the `REACT_APP_STAGE` variable to `prod`. This is when we push to `master`. The `branch-deploy` is what we will be using when we push to any other non-production branch. The `deploy-preview` is for pull requests.

### Handle HTTP Status Codes

Just as the first part of the tutorial, we'll need to handle requests to any non-root paths of our app. Our frontend is a single-page app and the routing is handled on the client side. We need to tell Netlify to always redirect any request to our `index.html` and return the 200 status code for it.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />To do this, add a redirects rule at the bottom of `netlify.toml`:

``` toml
# Always redirect any request to our index.html
# and return the status code 200.
[[redirects]]
    from    = "/*"
    to      = "/index.html"
    status  = 200
```

### Modify the Build Command

To deploy our app to Netlify we need to modify the build commands in our `package.json`.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Replace the `scripts` block in your `package.json` with this.

``` coffee
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
```

You'll notice we are getting rid of our old build and deploy scripts. We are not going to be deploying to S3.

### Commit the Changes

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Let's quickly commit these to Git.

``` bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adding a Netlify build script"
```

### Push the Changes

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />We are pretty much done making changes to our project. So let's go ahead and push them to GitHub.

``` bash
$ git push
```

 Now we are ready to add our project to Netlify.
