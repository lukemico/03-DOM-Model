// The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.

// A prime number is a natural number that has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself.

// Setup a HTML file and a JS file
// Link the 2 files together

// Create your range, starting at two and ending at the given limit.
// Create an array that starts at the number 2 and finishes as 120.
// var range = [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20];

// The algorithm consists of repeating the following over and over:
// Create an If statement that iterates from 2 to 120. Conditions to be included -

// take the next available unmarked number in your list (it is prime)
// iterate through the range of numbers checking if a number if has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself
// e.g. x = 1 and x % x is true
// if (range = 2, range => 2, range++) {
//  return ();
// }

// remove all the multiples of that number (they are not prime)

// return or Console Log only prime numbers

// Repeat until you don't have any possible primes left in your range.

// Write the function so that it stops at 120, and can go no further.
// This would either be a Else statement or possibly...


// When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that have not been removed are prime.
// Console Log a list of all prime numbers, the other numbers would be removed.


// console.log("This is a test");
