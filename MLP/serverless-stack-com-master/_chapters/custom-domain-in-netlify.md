description: To configure your React app with custom domains on Netlify and AWS, you need to point the Route 53 DNS to Netlify. Create a new Record set, add an A Record, and a CNAME for your new Netlify project.

Now that we have our first deployment, let's configure a custom domain for our app through Netlify. This step is assuming you have a domain in Route 53 back from the first part of the tutorial.

### Pick a Netlify Site Name

From the project page in Netlify, hit **Site settings**.

Under **Site information** hit **Change site name**.

The site names are global, so pick a unique one. In our case we are using `serverless-stack-2-client`. And hit **Save**.

This means that our Netlify site URL is now going to be `https://serverless-stack-2-client.netlify.com`. Make a note of this as we will use this later in this chapter.

### Domain Settings in Netlify

Next hit **Domain management** from the side panel.

And hit **Add custom domain**.

Type in the name of our domain, for example it might be `demo-serverless-stack.com`. And hit **Save**.

This will automatically add the www version as well and will ask you to configure your DNS.

### DNS Settings in Route 53

To do this we need to head back to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). and search for Route 53 as the service.

Click on **Hosted zones**.

And select the domain we want to configure.

Here click on **Create Record Set**.

Select **Type** as **A - IPv4 address** and set the **Value** to **104.198.14.52**. And hit **Create**.

Next hit **Create Record Set** again.

Set **Name** to `www`, **Type** to **CNAME - Canonical name**, and the value to the Netlify site name as we noted above. In our case it is `https://serverless-stack-2-client.netlify.com`. Hit **Create**.

And give the DNS around 30 minutes to update.

### Configure SSL

Back in Netlify, hit **HTTPS** in the side panel. And hit **Verify DNS configuration**.

If everything has been configured properly, you should be able to hit **Let's Encrypt Certificate**.

![Setup Let's Encrypt Certificate screenshot](/assets/part2/setup-lets-encrypt-certificate.png)

Next, confirm this by hitting **Provision certificate**.

![Select Provision certificate screenshot](/assets/part2/select-provision-certificate.png)

This process might take around 10 minutes to complete. But once complete, scroll down and hit **Force HTTPS**.

This forces your users to only use HTTPS to communicate with your app.

Now if you head over to your browser and go to your custom domain, your notes app should be up and running!

We have our app in production but we haven't had a chance to go through our workflow just yet. Let's take a look at that next.
