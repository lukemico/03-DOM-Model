# Project Jackson
_Incent Loyalty's React component lib_

## Getting started
1. Clone/pull the repo
2. Checkout your desired branch
3. Grab a .env file from your overlord, or create one similar to 
```
// .env
NODE_PATH=src/
NODE_ENV=development
```
4. Install dependencies: `yarn`
5. Run server: `yarn start`
6. Get back to work or you're fired

## Server Side Rendering
_@incnt/jackson uses `react-jss` which wraps `JSS`. 

Any SSR will need to follow the docs for `react-jss`: https://github.com/cssinjs/react-jss#server-side-rendering
