// The ` this ` keyword is used for:
// - To make code flexible
// - It saves time
//
// It is just JS trying to help by giving us a context. The code that is currently running, you probably care about this value
//
// There are 4 ways it is set up, but basically we find the callsite and look to the left and right
//
// The GLOBAL BINDING
// - Refers to the window
// - There won't be the new keyword, there won't be .call, .apply or .bind and it won't be a property
// - It should just be a function call on its own
//
// The IMPLICIT BINDING
// - Refers to the object that some method is in
// - There won't be the new keyword, there won't be .call, .apply or .bind. But it will be a method (there will be something before the function name). ` person.speak() `
//
// The EXPLICIT BINDING
// - Refers to exactly what we tell it to
// - There will be .call, .apply or .bind (the .bind saves it for later). There won't be new and it won't be a method call
// - ` sayHello.call(person); `
//
// The NEW BINDING
// - Refers to a new empty object
// - There won't be .call, .apply or .bind. It won't be a method. But there will be the word ` new `
// - ` new Person() `
