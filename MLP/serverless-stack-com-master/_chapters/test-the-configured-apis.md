description: Test the Serverless APIs that have been deployed using Seed. To do so use the "aws-api-gateway-cli-test" NPM package and test both the production and dev environments.

Now we have two sets of APIs (prod and dev), let's quickly test them to make sure they are working fine before we plug our frontend into them. Back in the [Test the APIs]({% link _chapters/test-the-apis.md %}) chapter, we used a simple utility called [AWS API Gateway Test CLI](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/aws-api-gateway-cli-test).

Before we do the test let's create a test user for both the environments. We'll be following the exact same steps as the [Create a Cognito test user]({% link _chapters/create-a-cognito-test-user.md %}) chapter.

### Create Test Users

We are going to use the AWS CLI for this.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />In your terminal, run.

``` bash
$ aws cognito-idp sign-up \
  --region YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_REGION \
  --client-id YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID \
  --username admin@example.com \
  --password Passw0rd!
```

Refer back to the [Deploying through Seed]({% link _chapters/deploying-through-seed.md %}) chapter to look up the **dev** version of your Cognito App Client Id. And replace `YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_REGION` with the region that you deployed to.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Next we'll confirm the user through the Cognito Admin CLI.

``` bash
$ aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up \
  --region YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_REGION \
  --user-pool-id YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID \
  --username admin@example.com
```

Again, replace `YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` with the **dev** version of your Cognito User Pool Id from the [Deploying through Seed]({% link _chapters/deploying-through-seed.md %}) chapter and the region from the previous command.

Let's quickly do the same with **prod** versions as well.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />In your terminal, run.

``` bash
$ aws cognito-idp sign-up \
  --region YOUR_PROD_COGNITO_REGION \
  --client-id YOUR_PROD_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID \
  --username admin@example.com \
  --password Passw0rd!
```

Here use your prod version of your Cognito details.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />And confirm the user.

``` bash
$ aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up \
  --region YOUR_PROD_COGNITO_REGION \
  --user-pool-id YOUR_PROD_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID \
  --username admin@example.com
```

Make sure to use the prod versions here as well.

Now we are ready to test our APIs.

### Test the API

Let's test our dev endpoint. Run the following command:

``` bash
$ npx aws-api-gateway-cli-test \
--username='admin@example.com' \
--password='Passw0rd!' \
--user-pool-id='YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID' \
--app-client-id='YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID' \
--cognito-region='YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_REGION' \
--identity-pool-id='YOUR_DEV_IDENTITY_POOL_ID' \
--invoke-url='YOUR_DEV_API_GATEWAY_URL' \
--api-gateway-region='YOUR_DEV_API_GATEWAY_REGION' \
--path-template='/notes' \
--method='POST' \
--body='{"content":"hello world","attachment":"hello.jpg"}'
```

Refer back to the [Deploying through Seed]({% link _chapters/deploying-through-seed.md %}) chapter for these:

- `YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` and `YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID` are all related to your Cognito User Pool.
- `YOUR_DEV_IDENTITY_POOL_ID` is for your Cognito Identity Pool.
- And `YOUR_DEV_API_GATEWAY_URL` is your API Gateway endpoint. It looks something likes this `https://ly55wbovq4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`. But if you have configured it with a custom domain use the one from the [Set custom domains through Seed]({% link _chapters/set-custom-domains-through-seed.md %}) chapter.
- Finally, the `YOUR_DEV_API_GATEWAY_REGION` and `YOUR_DEV_COGNITO_REGION` is the region you deployed to. In our case it is `us-east-1`.

If the command is successful, it'll look something like this.

``` bash
Authenticating with User Pool
Getting temporary credentials
Making API request
{ status: 200,
  statusText: 'OK',
  data: 
   { userId: 'us-east-1:9bdc031d-ee9e-4ffa-9a2d-123456789',
     noteId: '8f7da030-650b-11e7-a661-123456789',
     content: 'hello world',
     attachment: 'hello.jpg',
     createdAt: 1499648598452 } }
```

Also run the same command for prod. Make sure to use the prod versions.

``` bash
$ npx aws-api-gateway-cli-test \
--username='admin@example.com' \
--password='Passw0rd!' \
--user-pool-id='YOUR_PROD_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID' \
--app-client-id='YOUR_PROD_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID' \
--cognito-region='YOUR_PROD_COGNITO_REGION' \
--identity-pool-id='YOUR_PROD_IDENTITY_POOL_ID' \
--invoke-url='YOUR_PROD_API_GATEWAY_URL' \
--api-gateway-region='YOUR_PROD_API_GATEWAY_REGION' \
--path-template='/notes' \
--method='POST' \
--body='{"content":"hello world","attachment":"hello.jpg"}'
```

And you should see it give a similar output as dev.

Now that our APIs our tested we are ready to plug these into our frontend. But before we do that, let's do a quick test to see what will happen if we make a mistake and push some faulty code to production.
