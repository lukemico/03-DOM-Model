description: To automate our Serverless deployments with Seed (https://seed.run), we will need to set our secrets in the Seed console. Move the environment variables from your env.yml to the stage we are deploying to.

Before we can do our first deployment, we need to make sure to configure our secret environment variables. If you'll recall, we have explicitly not stored these in our code (or in Git). This means that if somebody else on our team needs to deploy, we'll need to pass the `env.yml` file around. Instead we'll configure [Seed](https://seed.run) to deploy with our secrets for us.

To do that, hit the **Settings** button in our **dev** stage.

Here click **Show Env Variables**.

And type in `stripeSecretKey` as the **Key** and the value should be the `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY` back from the [Load secrets from env.yml]({% link _chapters/load-secrets-from-env-yml.md %}) chapter. Hit **Add** to save your secret key.

Next we need to configure our secrets for the `prod` stage. Head back to the service page and click on **prod**.

Hit the **Settings** button.

Click **Show Env Variables**.

And type in `stripeSecretKey` as the **Key** and the value should be the `STRIPE_PROD_SECRET_KEY` back from the [Load secrets from env.yml]({% link _chapters/load-secrets-from-env-yml.md %}) chapter. Hit **Add** to save your secret key.

Next, we'll trigger our first deployment on Seed.
