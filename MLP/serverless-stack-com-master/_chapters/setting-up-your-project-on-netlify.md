Now we are going to set our React app on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). Start by [creating a free account](https://app.netlify.com/signup).

Next, create a new site by hitting the **New site from Git** button.

Pick **GitHub** as your provider.

Then pick your project from the list.

It'll default the branch to `master`. We can now deploy our app! Hit **Deploy site**.

This should be deploying our app. Once it is done, click on the deployment.

And you should see your app in action!

Of course, it is hosted on a Netlify URL. We'll change that by configuring custom domains next.
